    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple recipe for pasta with cottage cheese came from the Polish side of my family. We call it "cottage cheese and noodles" or "lazy man pierogies." It's a great comfort food and can be made with any kind of noodle. You can serve it as a side dish, but we always enjoy it as a main course.</p>
